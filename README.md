# Overflowed

Overflowed is a small library allowing you to build better responsive websites. It's currently in it's alpha stage and the APIs are potentially unstable, but I aim to satisfy the following goals before a stable version.

- ⚛️ Works across all major frameworks
- 🌳 Small and dependency-free, tree-shakable
- 🏗️ Bundled with strong TypeScript declarations
- 🎨 Infinitely customizable, not very opinionated, sensible defaults
- ⚡ Highly optimized and performant
- 📚 Clean API with nice documentation
- ♿ Accessible and allows for a clean DOM
- ↩️ Supports right-to-left writing modes
- 🦄 Polyfills/ponyfills can be provided
- ⚙️ Falls back nicely when SSR
- 🧩 Ships with module or CJS bundles

## Installation

```
npm install overflowed
yarn add overflowed
pnpm add overflowed
```
