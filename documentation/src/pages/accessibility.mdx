Ensuring website's accessibility is a big responsability to be taken seriously. Overflowed [works in
a slightly hacky way](/how-it-works) and so aims to make sure it's usage isn't at the detriment of
accessible practices.

I would love feedback on how accessibility can be improved, either as a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/ahtcx/overflowed/issues) or privately
[by email](mailto:overflowed@aht.cx).
